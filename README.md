# Information Gathering via Open Source Intelligence

Digital Systems, University of Piraeus, 2023

## Abstract
This thesis examines the increasing significance of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in the age of freely available information. With the rise of openly accessible information the value of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations and tools are accentuated. The data sources used in OSINT is data available from a non private source. Its roots can be traced to military intelligence collection techniques, where during the second World War OSINT techniques were utilized for intelligence collection about the enemy.
Its recent form, was introduced with the Iranian Protests of 2009. In the 21st century OSINT techniques and sources are mainly used in cybersecurity operations and for keeping tabs on global events. This is largely because of the abundance of information on the internet and how simple it is to obtain and evaluate it. Red teams simulate attacks against a target, find holes and flaws in their defenses, and make recommendations for strengthening company security posture, therefore high-yield information collection is critical. OSINT can assist them in the gathering of data about a target’s personnel, corporate operations, and infrastructure. On the other hand, Blue teams can utilize open sources of threat data and analytics to prepare their defenses according to threats. Furthermore, recent events such as the war in Ukraine have resulted in wider utilization of Open Source Intelligence and information collection.
The widespread use of social media has resulted in an abundance of publicly available data on people’s and business’ profiles. Major events taking place, such as protest and wars have a measurable impact online. When conducting an OSINT investigation the topic of ethics should be raised. In order to avoid putting peoples privacy in danger and to produce the best investigation results certain judgement criteria are proposed.
